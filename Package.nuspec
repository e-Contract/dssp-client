    <title>Digital Signature Service Protocol Client</title>
    <description>Client for the "Digital Signature Service Protocol" as offered by e-Contract.be</description>
    <summary>
      The new Digital Signature Service creates PAdES LTV signatures using the eID card according to the latest ETSI PAdES Baseline Profile version 2.2.2.
      This standard is being pushed by the EC e-Signatures Expert Group to guarantee maximum recognition and interoperability of signed documents between
      EU member states. Furthermore the Digital Signature Service product is not limited to PDF signatures. It also support XAdES-X-L and ETSI XAdES Baseline
      Profile version 2.1.1 signatures (LT-Level compliance). The new DSS is the only solution today on the market offering such compliance.

      The new Digital Signature Service comes with a new and highly secure Digital Signature Service Protocol. This protocol is a derivative of work that
      we performed within the OASIS DSS-X group and offers maximum protection against various types of attacks. From a security point of view, this new protocol
      is just it. The old protocol, as implemented in the original eID DSS, could easily be integrated in an insecure way by the developer. For the new protocol,
      this is no longer possible given the design of the protocol. As we all know that protocols (and their implementation, especially authentication protocols)
      are very vulnerable to attacks, this new protocol is a huge step forward. This makes the new Digital Signature Service truly unique compared to other
      solutions.
