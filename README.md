# DSSP client for .NET

This project contains the source code of the Digital Signature Service Protocol SDK for .NET web applications.
We support .NET version 3.5+.

The Digital Signature Service itself can be tested via the [DSS demo portal](https://www.e-contract.be/dss/).

## Getting started

The `forms-demo` gives you an entry-level example on how to use the DSSP client for .NET.
A more advanced example is given in `webApi-demo`.

Check out the source code and open `dssp-client.sln` with for example [Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx). The project should compile and run out of the box.

A [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DSS-P.Client/) package has also been make available.

To get a DSS account, send us an email with your application logo (max 130x130) at `info at e-contract.be`.
